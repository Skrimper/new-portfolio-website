    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Donovan Johnson, and I've always been interested in two things: art and skiing. I've been doing both my entire life, and I used to compete in freeride ("big mountain") skiing. After attending the Winter Sports School, I decided to get a degree in web and graphic design from Salt Lake Community College. I am close to graduating, and I hope to work on something that blends my two passions of design and the outdoors. Welcome to my all-encompassing website, where I share and sell my artwork in various forms!</p>
